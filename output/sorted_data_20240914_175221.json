            "Background": "In the JAVELIN Bladder 100 phase 3 trial, avelumab 1LM + best supportive care (BSC) significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) vs BSC alone in pts with aUC that had not progressed with 1L platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC).",
            "Methods": "Eligible pts with unresectable locally advanced (LA) or metastatic UC without progression after 1L PBC were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab + BSC (n=350) or BSC alone (n=350). The primary endpoint was OS measured from randomization; secondary endpoints included PFS and safety.",
            "Results": "In the avelumab + BSC and BSC alone arms, 159 and 159 pts had nonvisceral metastases and 51 and 51 pts had LN-only disease, of whom 42 and 35 pts had LN-only disease in the pelvic/retroperitoneal area. Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with avelumab were similar across subgroups.",
            "Conclusions": "Exploratory analyses suggest that avelumab 1LM has pronounced efficacy and manageable toxicity in pts with aUC who have low tumor burden, supporting its use as a standard of care in this setting."
