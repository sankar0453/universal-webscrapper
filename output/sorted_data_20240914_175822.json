            "Background": "Exploratory analyses suggest that avelumab 1LM has pronounced efficacy and manageable toxicity in pts with aUC who have low tumor burden, supporting its use as a standard of care in this setting.",
            "Methods": "Eligible pts with unresectable locally advanced (LA) or metastatic UC without progression after 1L PBC were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab + BSC (n=350) or BSC alone (n=350).",
            "Results": "In all subgroups, OS and PFS were prolonged with avelumab + BSC vs BSC alone.",
            "Conclusions": "Exploratory analyses suggest that avelumab 1LM has pronounced efficacy and manageable toxicity in pts with aUC who have low tumor burden, supporting its use as a standard of care in this setting."
